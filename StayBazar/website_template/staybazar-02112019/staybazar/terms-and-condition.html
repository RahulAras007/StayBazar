          <li>The Property will indemnify Staybazar in respect of each and every liability arising out of the infringement of copyrights (e.g. regarding to photographic material provided by the Property) and claims by guests concerning erroneous information of the Property on the website or any other claims related to services provided by the Property. Staybazar excludes any and all liability in respect of the Property which is related to a (temporary) breakdown of the Websites.

Staybazar will then have the right to re-negotiate the Agreement to reflect the loss of facilities. The Property guarantees to indemnify Staybazar against any loss or damage of whatever nature suffered by Staybazar as a result of the unavailability of offered facilities. If any facility attached to an accommodation already booked by Staybazar clients, then the Property must immediately notify Staybazar of the change by fax email within 12 hours of the knowledge of the facilities becoming unavailable.

              <li>encourage Staybazar customers to do their accommodation booking directly through the Staybazar portal, to the extent possible.</li>
            </ol>

            </ol>
</li>
<li>FORCE MAJEURE / INABILITY TO HONOR RESERVATIONS: A Property’s failure to perform under this Agreement is excused if the failure results from an unforeseeable cause beyond Property’s control, such as war, work stoppage, fire, weather events, air carrier interruption, or act of government.</li>
